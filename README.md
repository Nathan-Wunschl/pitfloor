# Pitfloor
A metadata fixer for metal music written in python

### Why This Exists
I created this script for multiple issues that I have faced with owning my own music collection...

1. Sometimes, artist names would be inconsistent across record labels. In specific, capitalization. (i.e. Putrid Pile vs. PUTRID PILE)
2. Record label names would be set as the artist, rather than the artist themselves (i.e New Standard Elite vs. Cerebral Effusion)
3. Album names would contain artist name (i.e Condemned - Desecrate the Vile)
4. Years would be incorrect due to record label release (i.e. 2001 vs 2015)
